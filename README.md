# MMOperationQueue
## MMOperationQueue is a wrapper for OperationQueue. It takes care of asynchronous operations and offers a simpler api.

### Example
``` Swift
let operationsQueue = MMOperationsQueue()

let operation1 = MMAsynchronousExampleOperation()!

let operation2 = MMAsynchronousExampleOperation()!
operation2.successDependencies = [operation1]

let operation3 = MMSyncExampleOperation()!
operation3.dependencies = [operation2]

operationsQueue?.completionBlock = {
  self.operationsQueue = nil
}

operationsQueue?.addOperations(operations: [operation1, operation2, operation3])
```
